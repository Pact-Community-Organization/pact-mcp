# AUDIT — library/token-fixed-supply-gov

## 2.0.0 — Derivation statement

Version 2.0.0 replaces the 1.0.0 module wholesale. It is **derived from a
production contract live on Kadena mainnet that passed two independent cold
audits** (fresh-context adversarial reviews of the deployed lineage); **the
template itself is self-reviewed** — the derivation carries the reviewed
semantics, not the audit verdicts, and any deploy of this template should be
validated independently.

The voting, transfer, and release semantics match the production contract.
The structural deltas, each verified by the co-located suites:

- **`burned` removed** — the supply schema is `minted:decimal` only; the
  production module carried a dead `burned` field (always 0.0, no burn path).
- **`gov-counts` removed** — question ids are operator-supplied, so the id
  counter table was dead state.
- **Margins merged** — the pairwise head-to-head matrix is a field
  (`m:[decimal]`) on the question row, initialized to K×K zeros at
  `create-proposal`, instead of a separate `rcv-margins` table. Every
  question therefore has a complete pairwise record from its first ballot,
  and the production `available:false` case (questions predating the record)
  cannot exist and is not reported.

Also cleaned relative to the production source: no deployment-specific
`bless` line (a fresh deploy has no history; the upgrade duty is documented
in README §Operational warnings), generic naming, and deploy literals marked
`EDIT-BEFORE-DEPLOY`.

Suites: `tests/token-gov.repl`, `tests/negatives.repl`, `tests/pairwise.repl`
— all green under `pact` 5.4. Static analysis: 0 VIOLATIONs; 13 WARNs, every
one an `enforce-keyset`/`enforce-guard` sitting inside a defcap body (the
scoped-signature pattern; same disposition as 1.0.0). Known coverage gap: the
`FROZEN-MODULE` refusal branch is a source literal and is not exercised by
the suites — rehearse the freeze on devnet (README §Known limits).

Everything below this line documents **version 1.0.0** (the yes/no/abstain
single-chain design that 2.0.0 replaces) and is retained as review history.

## Summary

| | |
|---|---|
| Version | 1.0.0 |
| Audit status | `self-reviewed` (see §What self-reviewed means here) |
| Review | Independent adversarial review, fresh context, 2026-07-18 |
| Initial verdict | NO-GO as written: 1 MEDIUM (F1) + 2 LOW (F2, F3) |
| Final verdict | **GO** after the reviewer-prescribed F1/F2 fixes landed and the suite re-ran green; F3 documented |
| Suite | `examples/fixed-supply-token-gov-test.repl` (removed with the 1.0.0 module; in git history) — green; worst-case governance-loaded transfer gas measured AND asserted (489 ≪ 150k) |
| Static analysis | 0 VIOLATIONs; WARNs dispositioned (guard enforcement lives in defcap bodies) |

## Purpose

The fixed-supply, non-upgradeable token extended with **advisory** governance:
proposals + live balance-weighted voting with permanent tallies and **no
execution surface**. Claims under review: tallies can never be forged or
amplified; sold/moved/burned tokens can never keep voting; the public
`release-votes` sync is harmless; governance load on transfers is bounded;
closed tallies are immutable.

## Capability model (reviewer's summary, post-fix, re-verified)

> The module's authority model is minimal and terminal: `GOV` is
> unsatisfiable (`enforce false`), so no upgrade, admin, or table-creation
> surface exists after the deploy transaction. All value movement flows
> through the managed `TRANSFER` capability (linear budget via
> `TRANSFER-mgr`), composing `DEBIT` — the sender's own account guard — with
> the weak-body internal `CREDIT` token; `credit`, `debit`, and
> `cast-vote-internal` are sealed behind `require-capability`, and `CREDIT`
> is only ever acquired under a real upstream guard (the one-shot `MINT`
> keyset, made unrepeatable by the supply-row insert, or `TRANSFER`'s debit
> guard), so no free-mint path exists. Every user-facing authorization —
> `TRANSFER`, `BURN`, `ROTATE`, `PROPOSE`, and per-proposal `VOTE` — enforces
> the account's own guard inside a capability body, so wallets can sign with
> capability-scoped signatures throughout and never need to expose an
> unscoped key. Governance adds no authority at all: tallies derive
> exclusively from real balances (weight = current balance, shrink-only
> public sync on every balance decrease, credits never vote), the proposal
> threshold is deploy-enforced positive, and no capability, function, or
> module surface consumes a tally — votes are permanently recorded advisory
> signals with no execution lever. Independently exercised attack harnesses
> (vote-transfer-revote cycles, hostile syncs, scoped-signature spoofing,
> degenerate deploy parameters, worst-case governance-loaded gas at
> 489/150,000) produced no violation.

## Findings and dispositions

| # | Sev | Finding | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | **MED** | Voting/proposing/rotation used bare `enforce-guard` in defun bodies — capability-scoped signatures could never satisfy them, forcing every voter to sign UNSCOPED (a wallet-security anti-pattern a public template would teach). | **FIXED** as prescribed: `PROPOSE`/`VOTE`/`ROTATE` defcaps added; write paths wrapped; `cast-vote-internal` sealed with `require-capability`. Suite now proves scoped-sig proposing and voting positively, plus the negative (attacker key carrying a scoped VOTE cap for another account still fails). Base template got `ROTATE` for parity. |
| F2 | LOW | `proposal-threshold` could floor to 0.0 under legal deploy parameters (e.g. precision 0, small supply, minimum fraction), silently letting zero-balance accounts propose. Reviewer-proven in a probe. | **FIXED** as prescribed: `PROPOSAL-THRESHOLD` is a load-time defconst with `(enforce (> t 0.0))` — the degenerate parameter combination now refuses to deploy. |
| F3 | LOW | Proposal-slot squatting: a threshold-holder can occupy all 3 active slots with 720h windows and race re-grabs at expiry, crowding the advisory channel. Recoverable, contestable, advisory-only. | Documented in README §Known limits (including the gov-threshold sizing advice). Per-account limits/deposits left to forks — a deliberate simplicity trade-off. |
| F4 | INFO | `release-votes` mutates tallies without an event; indexers must replay transfers/burns against the open set to reconstruct tallies. | Documented here. No event added: a per-shrink event would charge every transfer for indexer convenience, and the source-of-truth tallies are always readable on-chain (`get-proposal`/`get-results`). |
| F5 | INFO | Suite's gas measurement was not worst case (1 live vote, not 3). | **FIXED**: suite votes on all 3 open proposals, measures 489 gas, and asserts the bound instead of printing it. |
| F6 | INFO | Duplicated fungible core under-covered vs the base suite (no crosschain/rotate checks). | **FIXED**: crosschain-disabled assertion + rotate coverage (scoped-sig vanity rotate, principal-rotation rejection) added. |
| F7 | INFO | No AUDIT.md at review time. | This file. |
| F8 | INFO | Closed pids persist in `gov-actives` until the next `create-proposal` prunes (≤3 stale reads per transfer meanwhile; self-heals). | Accepted as-is; cosmetic, provably bounded. |

## Attacks attempted (reviewer-executed)

> **Scope.** This lists the routes this review actually exercised and what each one

> evidence of safety. Validate independently before deploying with real value.

- **Vote→transfer→re-vote double-count** across split accounts and circular
  transfers: tally always equals the sum of voters' current balances; never
  amplified; tally ≤ circulating supply held throughout. Release is computed
  on the **post-debit** balance.
- **Hostile `release-votes`**: no-op on healthy and nonexistent accounts
  (byte-identical state); the shrink math cannot underflow a tally column
  (column = Σ row-weights maintained in lockstep).
- **Tally-freeze bypass**: no post-close write path; `cast-vote` and
  `open-ids` use the same strict time bound, so no closed-but-mutable window.
- **Index wedge**: proposal insert + active-index write are same-tx atomic;
  the stored index is provably ≤ 3 entries; `open-ids`' filter can never read
  a missing row.
- **vkey forgery**: digit-only pids + reserved-name account rules make
  `"<pid>:<account>"` keys unambiguous.
- **Free-mint / squat / rotation / managed-budget attacks** on the duplicated
  core: as the base template (see its AUDIT.md); shared core diffed against
  the base — byte-identical except the two `release-votes` call sites.
- **Node-vs-REPL divergence**: every enforce condition uses pre-bound values;
  guard reads only in `enforce-guard` argument position.

## Liveness

Transfers and burns are holder-guarded, compose with no governance state
beyond the bounded (≤3, 489-gas) release work, and can never be wedged by
proposals. Closed proposals, vote rows, and the supply row persist forever by
design (the permanent record is the product). No trapped value.

## What self-reviewed means here

Adversarial and independent of the implementation session (fresh context,
cold read, reviewer-authored probe harnesses for scoped signatures, the
zero-threshold edge, and worst-case gas), but performed within the PCO. Per
docs/CONTRACT_POLICIES.md §3.1 that is `self-reviewed`, not "audited". A
qualifying independent community review promotes the entry.

## Reproduce the review

```bash
# 1.0.0 only — check out the 1.0.0 tree from git history first:
cd examples && pact fixed-supply-token-gov-test.repl   # suite green, gas asserted
```

Same REPL discipline note as the base template: `expect-failure` does not
roll back partial writes and cannot wrap `load` — negative write-capable
cases live in `(rollback-tx)` transactions; bad-deploy aborts (including the
zero-threshold refusal) are verified manually.

## 2.0.0 — independent cold review (pre-merge)

Fresh-context audit of the template as shipped: **no CRITICAL, HIGH or MEDIUM findings.** One LOW
(escrow registration not retroactive — dispositioned as documentation, see README; the code fix
was rejected as a live-tally striking power) and three INFO (release-path event gap, the
missing-table deploy hazard, disclosed pre-freeze upgradeability), all recorded in the README.
The structural deltas from the production ancestor were each verified: the pairwise-matrix merge
held under K=5 hand-computed ballots, idempotent re-votes, partial-release exactness, and
full-lifecycle unwind to exact zero; foreign capability composition was confined to a legitimate
self-vote at real weight.
