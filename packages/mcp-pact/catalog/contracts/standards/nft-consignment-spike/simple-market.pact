;; simple-market — a reference nft-marketplace
;;
;; A permissionless sale contract that owns NO tokens. It sells any nft-asset
;; consigned to its guard. Deployed into ITS OWN namespace (the spike deploys two
;; copies in two namespaces to prove "gallery to gallery"). Its fee account and
;; rate are its own policy; the asset caps the fee it will accept.
;;
;; The Pact-5 pattern (design note): execute-sale is PUBLIC and acquires SELL
;; internally, then calls nft::buy — a caller cannot acquire SELL from outside.
;; The NFT is a modref parameter, so one market sells any conforming NFT.
