;; nft-single — a self-sovereign, frozen-at-mint NFT (spike reference template)
;;
;; ONE NFT = ONE MODULE, deployed in the ARTIST's namespace. The artist governs
;; deployment, but the module FREEZES ITSELF at mint: GOVERNANCE refuses every
;; upgrade once minted, so royalty/creator/supply are immutable even to the
;; artist. The NFT owns its own escrow and pays its own royalty on every sale,
;; regardless of which marketplace (in which namespace) triggers it.
;;
;; The namespace this loads into is supplied at deploy (read-msg 'ns); the admin
;; keyset name likewise. In the spike these are the artist's test namespace.
