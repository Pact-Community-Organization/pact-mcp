;; nft.dutch-auction — declining-price (Dutch) auction as a registered sale
;; contract for the nft framework.
;;
;; The seller offers the token through the ledger's sale pact with a quote
;; naming this contract (price 0 — discovered here), then creates the auction:
;; a start price stepping DOWN to a floor price over fixed intervals. The
;; first buyer to settle at the current interval price wins; there is no bid
;; escrow — the buyer pays from their own fungible account exactly like a
;; fixed-price sale, and the framework's single conservation-asserted
;; settlement carves the quote-bound royalties and marketplace fee from the
;; accepted price (a Dutch sale is not a royalty bypass).
;;
;; PRICE INTEGRITY: the buy transaction carries only a CANDIDATE price; the
;; manager dispatches it to enforce-quote-update here, which enforces it
;; EQUALS the current curve price for the executing block. The price is
;; constant within an interval, so an honest buyer's candidate matches
;; deterministically; nothing about the price can be injected.
;;
;; The curve is monotonically non-increasing: each full elapsed interval
;; drops the price by (start-price - floor-price)/intervals, quantized to the
;; quote fungible's precision, never below the floor. Purchasable only inside
;; [start, end); withdrawal is free before start, blocked while live, free
;; after end if unsold (nothing is ever escrowed here, so no funds can
;; strand).
;;
;; The settlement hooks are unreachable outside the manager's path (they
;; require the manager's QUOTE-CALL / WITHDRAWAL-CALL capabilities).
