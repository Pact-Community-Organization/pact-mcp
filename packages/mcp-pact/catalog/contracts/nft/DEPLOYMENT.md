# Deploying the NFT framework

How to put the framework on a Chainweb network (devnet, testnet, or a KDA-CE
network). The executable source of truth for the sequence is
`scripts/devnet-validate/src/nft-framework.ts` — the deploy tail there (module
source + `create-table` list per module) is exactly what a real train submits.
This page explains the order, the namespace decision, and the one rule that
cannot be walked back.

## The one-shot rule

Module names are fixed by cross-references (`ledger` statically names
`policy-manager` and `util`; the six policies and both auctions statically name
`policy-manager`; `policy-manager` itself names no module statically — it holds
the ledger and the sale contracts as runtime-registered modrefs, late-bound by
name). **A namespace gets ONE
shot at a clean deploy**: if a train aborts half-way and leaves wrong state, a
redo needs either the module upgrade path or a NEW namespace — the names in the
old one are taken forever. Interfaces are stricter still: a deployed interface
is frozen (`CannotUpgradeInterface`); any change after deployment is a new
interface name, not an edit. Validate the full train on a devnet first, always.

## Namespace choice

- **Principal namespace (recommended).** Create it with
  `ns.create-principal-namespace` from an operator keyset; the name
  (`n_<hash>`) is derived from the keyset, so it cannot be squatted and cannot
  collide. Confirm the target network exposes `ns.create-principal-namespace`
  with a read-only `/local` call before planning around it (some devnet images
  ship without it).
- **`free` (validation only).** Open user guard, zero setup — but names are
  first-come and burned on failure (see the one-shot rule). Fine for a
  throwaway validation pass, not for anything that must stay deployed.

## Order, per chain

The full sequence, per chain (each step confirmed mined before the next —
cross-references resolve at load time):

0. **The v1 standard interfaces come first (separate train).** PCO publishes
   the Kadena NFT interface standard v1 (`contracts/standards/`:
   `nft-asset-v1`, `nft-market-v1`, `nft-xchain-v1`) into the PCO-owned
   principal namespace **before** any framework or marketplace deployment on
   that network — standalone marketplaces implement those interfaces fully
   qualified, so they must already exist everywhere a marketplace can deploy.
   The framework's own interfaces (step 2 below) are a separate, internal set;
   the two trains are independent, but the standard-v1 train runs first.
1. **Admin keyset** — `(namespace "<ns>") (define-keyset "<ns>.<admin>" ...)`.
   This keyset is the framework governance gate; on a real network it should be
   hardware-backed.
2. **Interfaces** — `interfaces/` in one transaction: `account-protocols`,
   `token-policy`, `poly-fungible`, `ledger-iface`, `sale`. Frozen at deploy.
3. **`core/util`**
4. **`core/policy-manager`** + its tables (`ledgers`, `quotes`, `sale-contracts`)
5. **`core/ledger`** + its tables (`ledger-table`, `tokens`)
6. **Policies** (each + its tables): `royalty-policy`, `non-fungible-policy`,
   and whichever of `collection-policy` / `guard-policy` / `guarded-uri-policy`
   / `non-updatable-uri-policy` the deployment needs. Policies are independent;
   deploy only what will be used — more can be added later.
7. **Sale contracts** (each + its table): `conventional-auction`,
   `dutch-auction`.
8. **Governance wiring** (admin-signed):
   `(<ns>.policy-manager.init <ns>.ledger)` then
   `(<ns>.policy-manager.register-sale-contract <ns>.conventional-auction)` and
   the same for `dutch-auction`. Nothing sells through an unregistered sale
   contract — this registration is the marketplace trust boundary.

## Verification

- Existence + integrity: `(describe-module "<ns>.<module>")` per chain — the
  hash, not an explorer page, is the proof. Record the per-chain hash table.
- Behavior: the `test/` suites (and `test/redteam/`) are the acceptance bar;
  run them against the sources you deployed, byte-identical.
- Cross-chain flows require a multi-chain network (two chains suffice; SPV is
  not testable in the bare REPL).
- Gas headroom: the heaviest measured operational leg is ~1.5k gas against the
  150k KDA-CE ceiling; full-module deploys are the largest transactions and
  still clear the ceiling comfortably.

## Published deployments

**testnet06** (2026-07-08): the full framework was deployed to **all 20 chains** in
the PCO principal namespace `n_e82dd10f74b7e8c253553de95629fdfa35cf8379`, in the
order above (standard-v1 interfaces first, framework train after).

> **Network-reset note (2026-07-18).** testnet06 was reset to a fresh genesis
> shortly after this deployment, which removed it along with everything else on
> the network. The framework itself is unchanged; re-deployment follows the same
> train once the network is back and namespace creation is available on the new
> genesis. Because the namespace derives from the PCO keyset and module hashes
> derive from source, the table below records the **expected values** for the
> re-deployment (byte-identical sources reproduce identical hashes).

Hashes are identical on every chain — verify with
`(at 'hash (describe-module "<ns>.<module>"))`:

| Module | Hash (×20 chains) |
|---|---|
| `util` | `gZTHFQtoSLAIvBMWZsTP3j5lSXJ5Hgea6ysOFSUM7aU` |
| `policy-manager` | `YThA21JyYQQccu2oozH8ZwKFlekK9R_N4JeZqN9diFE` |
| `ledger` | `dC0OstQbZ4VMTR9x83H1EaCKKlXOmwoJpMJvgD9jT-A` |
| `royalty-policy` | `PInIBNpp562xTfPERC_wZ4lCSORmZUwpeaRoqeN8yQE` |
| `non-fungible-policy` | `DfT5iDc9yX9e_Jaq4iPQ9YpiL9UB4KjUtIreAmOxSsU` |
| `collection-policy` | `cKuPk4E4eCTPBf4sU6tkam-1Gj6pi7DJ-iUEsQBmxyI` |
| `guard-policy` | `4mIXFB6rSw-Xe9kZqbfnDlm5-P3810Klh6im26zvD8o` |
| `guarded-uri-policy` | `K-yA78Ptw5dzsyeq8GD0C36kfPDaB86OOBO3qv0In8k` |
| `non-updatable-uri-policy` | `l4x3acxV4NejUbWCj1cFcFkeoenp-YOjpI1cRAFAB8o` |
| `conventional-auction` | `RMLGEY1-9VxoDQEaKgLraOSh8b0H3WyAMFOez2qftkA` |
| `dutch-auction` | `_NstxLsBlul172SUSCq67RL0NXgYI2cG_AZWKsnT4Qo` |

Both auctions are registered sale contracts (`policy-manager.init` + registration
executed as the train's final step per chain). This is a test-network deployment:
real mechanics, test value.

## Upgrades

Pre-production, prefer a fresh deploy: with no live state to preserve, a clean
namespace (or a wiped devnet) beats an in-place upgrade — no bless, no stale
callers, no half-upgraded system. The rules below matter the moment a
deployment has real state.

Blessing is necessary and NOT sufficient — and it is not what makes new code
run.

**1. Bless the previous hash.** In-flight sales and cross-chain steps carry
provenance from the old hash and complete against the blessed one. Never remove
a bless while any transaction started under that hash can still resume. The
bless that protects an in-flight cross-chain transfer belongs on `ledger` (the
module that yields), not on `policy-manager`.

**2. Redeploy every module that STATICALLY calls the upgraded one.** A direct
qualified call (e.g. `policy-manager.enforce-init`) compiles the callee's
module hash into the caller, and the caller keeps executing the OLD code until
it is itself redeployed — silently, because bless gates table access, not
dispatch. Blessing alone therefore converts a loud `hash not blessed` abort
into a silent stale-code window, and a stale caller's own modref hops still
reach CURRENT code: half-old, half-new inside one transaction.

Exempt: modules that reach the upgraded one only through a modref (`m::f`) or
only through `require-capability` — both re-resolve or drop the hash at call
time. Interfaces cannot be upgraded at all, so interface edges never go stale.

For this framework (the full static graph is in the one-shot rule above):

- upgrade `policy-manager` → redeploy `ledger`, all six policies, and both
  auctions (9 modules, depth 1 — nothing statically names any of them, so
  there is no transitive tail);
- upgrade `util` → redeploy `ledger`;
- upgrade `ledger`, a policy, or an auction → redeploy nothing (every inbound
  edge to them is a late-bound modref).

Order: upgrade the callee FIRST, then redeploy each caller byte-unchanged (a
caller redeployed before the callee upgrade recompiles against the old hash
and stays stale), then verify every module hash. A redeployed caller gets a
new hash of its own — bless its previous one by the same rule. Do NOT re-run
`create-table`, `policy-manager.init`, or `register-sale-contract` on an
upgrade pass — the registrations are late-bound by name and survive; the
`insert`s would abort. (The deploy script's tail appends `create-table` calls
to each module's source — an upgrade pass must submit the module source
without that tail.)
