;; nft.policy-manager — the HARDENED policy dispatcher + settlement engine.
;;
;; This is the module where the Marmalade architecture's real flaws are fixed
;; (our Marmalade V2 analysis: ARCH-1, ARCH-2):
;;
;;  ARCH-2 (economics-from-the-buyer's-tx): the sale QUOTE — price, fungible,
;;  seller payout account, and the marketplace fee (rate + payee) — is bound in
;;  STATE at OFFER time, from the seller's signed offer, and read from state at
;;  buy. The buyer supplies only their own paying account; they cannot set or
;;  zero any economic parameter.
;;
;;  ARCH-1 (shared-escrow sweep-what's-left): settlement is ONE routine. Each
;;  policy DECLARES its payout(s) (computed from the policy's own state) but
;;  moves no money; the manager pays every declared payout + the marketplace fee
;;  + the seller remainder from a single capability-guarded escrow and ASSERTS
;;  escrow-in = Σ payouts to the fungible's full precision. No policy hook holds
;;  spend authority over the escrow.
;;
;; Same-payee legs are merged (creator==seller, fee==seller, …) so a collision
;; can never brick a managed-transfer install.
;;
;; TRUST BOUNDARY — the quote's fungible: settlement necessarily executes the
;; quote fungible's own code while the per-sale ESCROW capability is in scope.
;; That capability is scoped to THIS sale-id (its escrow principal is
;; sale-unique and holds only this sale's funds) and the conservation assert
;; closes the ledger over exactly the quoted price — so a hostile fungible can
;; only misbehave inside the sale its own participants opted into. Policy hooks
;; run BEFORE the escrow capability is acquired, never inside it.
;;
;; Note: the `module{fungible-v2}` annotation on the PAYLOAD-sourced quote
;; fungible checks the tx-supplied `refSpec` interface list, not the named
;; module's real `implements` list, and dynamic dispatch is name-based — the
;; annotation is a shape check, never an interface-conformance guarantee. The
;; containment above (sale-scoped escrow + conservation assert) is what
;; actually bounds a hostile fungible; that is why the quote's fungible is a
;; documented trust boundary rather than a validated input.
;;
;; Quote rows are permanent: a settled or withdrawn sale keeps its quote row
;; (Pact has no row deletion; the one-shot sale defpact steps make replay
;; impossible). Treat `quotes` as the immutable sale-economics history — so the
;; EXISTENCE of a quote row is NOT evidence that its sale is still live.
;;
;; SALE LIVENESS: Pact exposes no builtin that reads defpact completion, so a
;; registered sale contract cannot ask the engine whether the ledger's sale
;; defpact for a sale-id is still running. This manager is the only party that
;; can answer: EVERY terminal transition of that defpact routes through it —
;; step-0 rollback through enforce-withdraw, step 1 through enforce-buy — so it
;; records the answer in the quote row's `active` flag (true at offer, false at
;; withdraw and at buy) and publishes it as `sale-live`. A sale contract that
;; takes on obligations or escrows money for a sale-id MUST gate on
;; `enforce-sale-live`: without it an auction can be attached to a corpse and
;; every bid escrowed into it is unrecoverable (nothing can settle or refund
;; once the defpact is complete).
