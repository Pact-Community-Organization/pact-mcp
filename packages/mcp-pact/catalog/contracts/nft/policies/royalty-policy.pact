;; nft.royalty-policy — genuinely enforced on-chain creator royalties.
;;
;; The royalty terms (creator, creator-guard, bps, sale-only) are REQUIRED in
;; the create-token transaction and bound into this policy's OWN state at init
;; — fail closed: a missing or partial spec aborts token creation (the POL-1
;; fix), and nothing about the royalty is ever read from a buy transaction
;; (the ARCH-2 fix).
;;
;; At settlement this policy DECLARES the creator's cut — computed from its
;; stored spec and the manager's state-bound quote price — and moves no money;
;; the policy-manager's single conservation-asserted settlement pays it (the
;; ARCH-1 / POL-3 fix).
;;
;; Sale-only is an explicit opt-in flag in the spec, enforced by rejecting
;; free transfers — a sale through the ledger's sale pact ALWAYS works and
;; always pays the royalty, so the royalty cannot be composed away by another
;; policy and never becomes a blanket transfer ban (the POL-2 fix). The
;; dust-price guard at offer rejects a price whose floored royalty would be
;; zero, closing the round-to-zero evasion path.
;;
;; CURRENCY: the royalty is denominated in the QUOTE's fungible — the seller
;; picks the sale currency per listing (multi-currency by design, matching the
;; catalog's marketplace standard). A creator who wants royalties in one fixed
;; currency can stack a currency-pinning policy; note that no on-chain rule can
;; stop economically-equivalent evasion (e.g. under-priced quotes settled
;; off-chain), so the guarantees here are: the rate binds at create, the cut is
;; computed from state, and every on-pact sale pays it.
;;
;; Every hook requires the ledger's matching -CALL capability in scope, so no
;; hook is reachable outside the real ledger lifecycle path.
