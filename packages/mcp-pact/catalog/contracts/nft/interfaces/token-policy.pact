;; nft.token-policy — the policy hook interface for the NFT framework.
;;
;; A concrete policy implements these hooks; the ledger (via the policy-manager)
;; maps them over every policy attached to a token at each lifecycle event. This
;; is the extension point where royalty, guard, collection, and sale-only
;; behavior live. Authored for the PCO `nft` framework (hardened successor to the
;; Marmalade v2 architecture); the framework's own original code, not a fork.
